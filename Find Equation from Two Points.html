    <h1>Find Equation of a Line</h1>
	<div style="width:700px">
	  <font size="4">I wrote the JavaScript code in this webpage based on the information from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathwarehouse.com/algebra/linear_equation/write-equation/equation-of-line-given-two-points.php">this page from Math Warehouse.</a></font>
	  <p><b>(Warning: This explanation is worded somewhat poorly and may be hard to understand. My bad.)</b> Sometimes when I'm making SM64DS TASes, I like to use the touch screen and use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a> to plot various points that I've selected on the touch screen. I'll also plot the slope that runs through these points as well. For example, if I want Mario to run at one specific angle towards the right, I'll pick one point on the touch screen, plot it in Desmos, then I'll pick/plot another point on the touch screen that is farther away and to the right of the previous point in order to make him run at that specific angle. To find more points on the touch screen that will make Mario run at that exact same angle, I'll find the equation of the two points I plotted and find more points that are farther away from those two points, but are on the same slope.</p>
	  <p><b>Note:</b> The Y-coordinates of points on the touch screen may appear to be positive, but you actually want to type their negative counterparts in the textboxes for the Y-coordinates. For example, if you found a point on the touch screen located at (72, 85), you would type -85 in the textbox for its Y-coordinate.</p>
