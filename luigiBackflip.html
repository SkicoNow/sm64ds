</head>
<body>
    <h1>SM64DS: Luigi Backflip Angle Patterns</h1>
    <p>See all the angles Luigi will face if he backflips/twirls a certain number of times. I originally made this sometime during Summer 2019 for the SM64DS No D-Pad Allowed Challenge, but I didn't know how to write the code for the "Clear" button at the time.</p>
    <!-- <p style="width:700px"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>This page isn't quite finished yet. Everything works correctly except for the "View Results" and "Clear" buttons. Clicking the "View Results" button will correctly display results based on what you typed in the two textboxes, but continuing to click it will just produce more and more results. Also, I want the "Clear" button to delete all the results created by the "View Results" button, but I haven't quite figured out how to delete HTML elements using JavaScript yet. For now, the only way to clear the results is to refresh the page.</p> -->
